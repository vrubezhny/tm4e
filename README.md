# Eclipse tm4e - TextMate and language-configuration support for Java and in Eclipse IDE

TM4E brings Java API to tokenize textual documents according to TextMate grammars with an Eclipse IDE client that can do syntax highlighting according to this tokenization; and Eclipse IDE client for  VSCode [Language Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeslanguages) to support matching bracket, auto close, on enter support.

`tm4e` is an [official Eclipse.org project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.tm4e) so it conforms to typical Eclipse.org requirements and guarantees.

## 📥 Install

### in Eclipse IDE or RCP applications

You can install `tm4e` with the update site [http://download.eclipse.org/tm4e/snapshots/](http://download.eclipse.org/tm4e/snapshots/). TM4E is usually installed together with its consumers, so end-user should usually not need to directly install it.

## ⌨️ Code

The following class and modules should be used as entry point provides:

 * [org.eclipse.tm4e.core](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.core) provides the Java TextMate tokenizer. This project is a Java port of [vscode-textmate](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-textmate) written in TypeScript. This Java API can be used with any Java UI Toolkit (Swing, Eclipse, etc). See [Core](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/wiki/Core) section for more information.

 * [org.eclipse.tm4e.ui](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.ui) provides the Eclipse **org.eclipse.jface.text.presentation.IPresentationReconciler** [TMPresentationReconciler](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/blob/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.ui/src/main/java/org/eclipse/tm4e/ui/text/TMPresentationReconciler.java) which is able to tokenize an editor content by using a given JSON, PList TextMate grammar and do syntax coloration. See [UI](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/wiki/UI) section for more information.

 * [org.eclipse.tm4e.languageconfiguration](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e/tree/master/org.eclipse.tm4e.languageconfiguration) provides the VSCode [Language Configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/extension-points#_contributeslanguages) to support matching bracket, auto close, on enter support with a simple **language-configuration.json**.
